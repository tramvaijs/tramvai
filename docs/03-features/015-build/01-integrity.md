## Subresource Integrity Support

You can enable support for the integrity mechanism for static assets (CSS/JS). To do this, add the following option to your configuration:

```
{
  "projects": {
    "projectName": {
      "name": "project-name",
      "integrity": true
    }
  }
}
```

Under the hood, the [webpack-subresource-integrity-plugin](https://github.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity) is used to generate integrity values. You can also configure the plugin itself:

```
{
  "projects": {
    "projectName": {
      "name": "project-name",
      "integrity": {
        "hashFuncNames": ["sha384"],
        "enabled": "auto",
        "hashLoading": "lazy"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

During the build, the plugin generates an integrity hash for each compiled asset and adds it to the `stats.json` file. At runtime, the server extracts the integrity value for each asset from `stats.json` when injecting assets into the HTML and adds the `integrity` attribute.

## Details and Limitations

Note that the integrity values are also added to the client bundle. This is necessary so that Webpackâ€™s runtime can load dynamic scripts via JSONP using integrity as well. If you have many asynchronous chunks, this can lead to a significant increase in the size of the synchronous chunk.

In such cases, the only viable solution is to reduce the number of asynchronous chunks.

Also, integrity does **not** work in a few cases:

- It doesn't work with child apps / module federation
- It doesn't account for `runtimeChunk: single`, which can lead to invalidation of the synchronous chunk in almost every build
