### Client routing with/without SPA transitions

By default, `tramvai` application is a combination of SSR and SPA approaches - at first request HTML page will be rendered server-side, then any in-app navigations on client-side will be SPA transitions. `SpaRouterModule` responsible for this behaviour:

```tsx
import { createApp } from '@tramvai/core';
import { SpaRouterModule } from '@tramvai/module-router';

createApp({
  name: 'awesome-app',
  modules: [SpaRouterModule],
});
```

Meanwhile, `tramvai` application easily can be transformed to multi-page app **without** SPA transitions, with `NoSpaRouterModule`:

```tsx
import { createApp } from '@tramvai/core';
import { NoSpaRouterModule } from '@tramvai/module-router';

createApp({
  name: 'awesome-app',
  modules: [NoSpaRouterModule],
});
```

### Navigation Lifecycle

Information about navigation lifecycle is available on [Navigation Flow page](03-features/07-routing/02-navigation-flow.md)

### Route and Url

Information about Route and Url is available on [Working with Url page](03-features/07-routing/03-working-with-url.md)

### Trailing Slash

Router will force all urls to end with slash, e.g. `/foo` path will be redirected to `/foo/`.

### Merge Slashes

Router will replace several consecutive slashes by single slashes (slashes after protocol are still be with `//` after protocol name), e.g. `/foo///bar/` path will be redirected to `/foo/bar/`.
