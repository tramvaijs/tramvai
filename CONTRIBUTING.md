## Introduction

Framework `tramvai` is in the process of incremental migration from our internal repo to open source.

Migration consists of several stages:

1. **Push synchronization**

   Current stage, automatic mirroring internal releases to `Github` repository

1. **Pull synchronization**

   Next stage, automatic mirroring pull requests from `Github` repository to our internal repo

1. **Full migration**

   Perspective stage, moving source code, and all CI processes (testing, linting, building, publishing, versioning) to `Github` repository

So for now contributors can open any issues and pull requests, but maintainers will need to manually transfer accepted changes to our internal repo.
